# apithings

`apithings` is a collection of tooling I always find myself rebuilding when a I need a simple "thing" i.e. I just need a basic status page or webhook relay or link shortener.

## Components

Right now the only component I've finished is a basic status site "thing". As other components get written, they'll start to (hopefully) coalesce in a set of blocks that play well together (i.e. the status thing can trigger the webhook thing)

### StatusThing

`statusthing` is a very simple status page backend. It doesn't support comments or historical data (yet? maybe soon?). It's intended to be a very simple status page backend.

The docs for `statusthing` are [here](https://github.com/lusis/apithings/blob/main/README.md)

#### StatusThing Quick Start

- Build and run the container
```
docker build --rm -f Dockerfile.statusthing -t statusthing .
docker run -p 9000:9000 --rm -i -t statusthing
```

- Add a service
```
curl -XPUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"status":"STATUS_YELLOW", "name":"tryhard","description":"ehhhhhhh"}' http://localhost:9000/statusthings/api/
curl -XPUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"status":"STATUS_GREEN", "name":"loool","description":"âœ…"}' http://localhost:9000/statusthings/api/
curl -XPUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"status":"STATUS_RED", "name":"uggg","description":"ðŸ’©"}' http://localhost:9000/statusthings/api/
```

- Open your browser to http://localhost:9000/statusthings

## Common behaviour
There is some configuration/behavior that will be common across all the 'things'

### ngrok support
You can expose your application via ngrok automatically as well by setting the `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN` environment variable.
This will expose the service over a random ngrok tunnel. Everything else behaves the same (i.e. setting an api key via `STATUSTHING_APIKEY` will still require an api key for requests).

If you would like to change the ngrok hostname/endpoint name, set the env var `NGROK_ENDPOINT` in addition to `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN`
